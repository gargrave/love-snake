# Love Snake

A "snake" game built with [Love](https://love2d.org/). It's not particularly feature-complete or anything, but maybe it's good for something to someone...

No assets are included, but the only thing you really might need is a font. Put your own font wherever you want, and update the reference at `src/snake/assets.lua#7`.

No license or restrictions, but the following MIT-licensed libs are included here:
